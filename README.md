## UI Inspiration
After benchmarking applications that record symptoms such as Period Calendar, Apple Health, Huawei Health, I decided to make a simple interface, without many tab options, only three highlighting the add symptom button. 

In the home page, I focused on showing the user relevant information such as the number of symptoms saved, statistics and exporting data.

In the Add symptom section, I added several dynamic elements such as severity selector and date selector. In a next iteration, it would be more user friendly if instead of an input to write the symptoms, I could have built predefined symptoms to help the user.
